# betterKite

Very simple "userscript" which adds following features to kite.zerodha.com ui

#### https://kite.zerodha.com/positions page
* Strategies are grouped in 3 ways.
  * (1) Strategies are auto grouped by script name. So all INFY strategies will be auto grouped under 'INFY'
  * (2) Strategies are auto grouped by expiry.
  * (3) Manual groups can be created by modifying 'positions array'.
* Once you select a strategy from the dropdown, only relevant positions will be shown.

* Filter stocks based on category. Once filter is applied only stocks in that category will be shown in 'watchlist' or 'orders' or 'holdings' screen
![header](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/zvefkb2pis0ygq4/headerWithTagSelector.png?dl=0)
* One stock can be in multiple categories.
* When you click on a stock in watchlist, if same stock is present in 'holdings', screen will be scrolled automatically bringing the stock in the middle and it will be highlighted for a few seconds.
