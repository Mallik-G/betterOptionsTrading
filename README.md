# betterKite

Very simple "userscript" which adds following features to kite.zerodha.com ui

#### https://kite.zerodha.com/positions page
* Strategies are grouped in 3 ways.
  * (1) Strategies are auto grouped by script name. So all INFY strategies will be auto grouped under 'INFY'
  * (2) Strategies are auto grouped by expiry.
  * (3) Manual groups can be created by modifying 'positions array'.
* Once you select a strategy from the dropdown, only relevant positions will be shown.

#### https://kite.zerodha.com/holdings page
* Group your holdings in 'categories' or 'tags'
* Small tag is shown next to your stock name indicating which category it belongs to.
![tags](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ygk9id8c21b3mi8/HoldingsWithTags.png?dl=0)
* Filter stocks based on category. Once filter is applied only stocks in that category will be shown in 'watchlist' or 'orders' or 'holdings' screen
![header](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/zvefkb2pis0ygq4/headerWithTagSelector.png?dl=0)
* One stock can be in multiple categories.
* When you click on a stock in watchlist, if same stock is present in 'holdings', screen will be scrolled automatically bringing the stock in the middle and it will be highlighted for a few seconds.



# How to use (below instruction is for holdings page, similar thing works on positions page as well)
* Once installation is done, go to 'holdings' page and click on 'Holdings (..)' text.
* Once you click you will see a dropdown (select box) next to kite logo on the header row. Between the logo and 'Dashboard' link.
* you can now filter 'orders' screen and 'holdings' screen based on your selection. Watchlist will also be filtered. Also when you click on watchlist row, if same stock is present in your holdings list, it will be highlighted and brought to focus.

* Process is same as taging holdings, important thing to keep in mind is the format of the tag.
* Tag should be formated as tagName.color for example: RT.red or BS.blue etc. 

# Steps for custom Positions. You don't need below step if auto grouping by script name works for you
* Format of the list
```
{
 "BajajFinanceStraddle" : ["12304386","12311298"],
 "BataRatioSpread": ["12431106"]
}
```

* Click on Tempermonkey icon -> then click on 'Option Strategies'.
* Copy paste your JSON object in the prompt.
* Page will refresh, now click on 'Positions(x)' text. You will see your custom strategies in the dropdown
